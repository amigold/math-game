# Pictures Folder

Add your picture files to this folder. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`

The game will randomly select pictures from this folder as rewards for completing the rainbow ball challenge (solving 3 problems in 2 minutes).

## Instructions:
1. Add your picture files directly to this folder
2. Files will be automatically detected by the game
3. Pictures should be reasonably sized (recommended: under 2MB each)

Example structure:
```
pictures/
  ├── picture1.jpg
  ├── picture2.png
  ├── picture3.jpg
  └── ...
```
